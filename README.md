This repository has the solutions to two Java exercises I did, plus some screenshots of the debugging process I performed in Eclipse. The exercises are the following:

- **Kata 1**: FizzBuzz
- **Kata 2**: Tamagotchi v1.0

## What's in this project?

Two exercises to learn how to use debugging in Eclipse. The exercises are already solved and I have used some breakpoints to see the flow of the program step by step while debugging it. They are in the **src** folder, and the screenshots are in the **screenshots** folder.

### **Kata 1: FizzBuzz**
The idea is to print the numbers 1 to 100, but with a couple of rules:
- If the number is divisible by 3, print ‘Fizz’.
- If it is divisible by 5, print ‘Buzz’.
- And if it is divisible by both, print ‘FizzBuzz’.

### **Kata 2: Tamagotchi v1.0**
Here I simulate a virtual pet, something like the Tamagotchi. The Tamagotchi is hungry, happy and energetic, and you can feed it, play with it or let it rest.

## Tools used

- Language: Java
- IDE: Eclipse
- **Debugging**: I used Eclipse breakpoints to see how the code executes and how variables change.

## How to run this?

1. Clone the repository on your machine:
   ````bash
   git clone https://github.com/Juls010/Katas.git
